    <h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p>Jewels is a simple, yet polished match-3 puzzle game similar to the original Bejeweled.
	This version is a port from the <a href="http://www.mhgames.org/jewels">
    original PC-version</a>, which I did earlier as an <i>XNA</i> programming exercise. After I got
    my <i>Android</i>-phone, it felt only natural to dive into the <i>Android</i>-platform by
    remaking this game. So, here we are.</p>
	
	<p>All that aside, the game is still quite fun to play. <b>:)</b> I daresay it actually works
	better as a mobile game, even though the graphical effects are obviously no match for the
	PC-version.</p>
	
    <a href="#" name="2"></a>
	<h2>3. HOW TO PLAY</h2>
	<p>Jewels follows the basic match-3 rules. You swap adjacent jewels to
    create combinations of three or more jewels in same color. You can either drag
	with your finger across two jewels, or touch a jewel, then another to initiate the swap.
	After removing jewels, new jewels drop down to the playfield. Quite often the falling jewels
    create new valid combinations, causing a chain reaction (or cascade), which
    grants you more points. The scoring is described at the end of this
    section.</p>
    
	<p>At the bottom of the screen you see a bonus bar, which slowly fills up as
    you remove jewels from the playfield. When the bonus bar reaches the end,
    you'll advance to the next bonus level. Between every level change, 16
    random jewels are also removed from the playfield. The bonus level
    corresponds to the bonus multiplier that affects your score.</p>

    <a href="#" name="2_1"></a>
    <h3>How the scoring works:</h3>
	<p>For three removed jewels you get <b>10</b> points. For four, you get <b>20</b> points
    and for five you get <b>30</b> points. When you destroy two or more sets of jewels
    in the same "chain" / cascade, every set gets <b>30</b> points more than the
    previous one. An example: you remove two jewel sets of three jewels each:
    <b>10p + (10+30)p = 10p + 40p = 50</b> points total.</p>
    
	<p>Every time you score, the points get multiplied by the bonus level
    multiplier. On the first level it's <b>1x</b>, on the second level it's <b>2x</b> and so
    on.</p>
    
    <p>The bonus bar requires an increasing amount of jewels to fill up at every
    level. In fact the jewels required for the next level are two times the
    previous amount required. For example, to reach level two, you need to
    destroy 80 jewels. To reach level three, you need to destroy 160 jewels.
    320 jewels for the fourth level, and so on.</p>
    
    <a href="#" name="2_2"></a>
    <h3>How the TIMED mode works:</h3>
	<p>In timed mode, the bonus bar serves as a time bar, which measures the
    time remaining. Once the bar reaches zero, there is no time left and the
    game is over.</p>
	
	<p>At each level the time bar starts from the half, and slowly
    decreases. You must spot and remove jewels fairly quickly in order to
    survive. You get more time for each set of jewels you remove. Cascades
    grant you even more time. Once the time bar fills up, you will advance to
    the next bonus level, and the time goes back to the half way again. The
    time goes a little bit faster on each bonus level.</p>
	
	<p>Spotting valid moves quickly and creating cascades is the key to the success in the TIMED
    mode.</p>
    
	<a href="#" name="2_3"></a>
	<h3>How the QUICK mode works</h3>
	<p>In quick mode, you have 75 seconds to earn as much points as possible. Act quickly, and with some luck you can
	have long cascades and get that high score! The timer is paused when the board gets refilled with jewels.</p>
	
	<p>The bonus represents the time left, decreasing constantly. The actual bonus level progress follows the logic of the NORMAL mode,
	except that it's sped up a bit in QUICK mode (i.e. you need less jewels to reach the next level).</p>
	</div> 
	
	<a href="#" name="2_4"></a>
	<h3>How the INFINITE mode works:</h3>
	<p>Due to popular demand, infinite mode was added in version 1.18. This mode
	is same as the normal mode, except that when there are no more moves to make, the game
	refills the board with fresh jewels.</p>
	
	<p>Do note that there are no high scores kept for the infinite mode, as it would be pretty much
	pointless to do so - after all there is nothing stopping people from playing for say, weeks,
	utilizing the save / continue -feature.</p>

    <h2>4. CREDITS</h2>
	<p>All the code, graphics and that sort of thing by <b>Mika Halttunen</b>. Come check
	out our other games at <a href="http://www.mhgames.org">MHGames.org</a>!</p>

	<p>The game idea is of course <b>heavily</b> inspired by the original
    Bejeweled and indirectly by Shariki, my hat's off to those guys who made the original games.</p>

	<p>Sound effects are from various places, most of them from XNA example games, as
	the original PC-version of Jewels used XNA. I've modified most of the sounds a bit,
	and mixed new sounds out of two or more existing samples.</p>
